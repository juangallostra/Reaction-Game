# Reaction-Game
Code that implements a 2 player game where a central Led is turned on at random and the players have to press as fast as they can their respective buttons. The first player to press his button wins.

## Requirements:
- Arduino
- 3 Leds
- 2 buttons
- 330 ohms resistors or similar (I used 3 of them: 1 for the Leds and 1 for each of the buttons)
