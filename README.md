# Reaction-Game
Code that implements a 2 player game where a central Led is turned on at random and the players have to press as fast as they can their respective buttons. The first player to press his button wins.

The code is quite simple, but the idea is to use it (at least that is what I did) as a starter project for anybody that wants to startand learn how to solder PCBs and electronic components.

## Needed materials:
- Arduino (I used an Arduino Nano)
- 3 Leds
- 2 buttons
- 330 ohms resistors or similar (I used 3 of them: 1 for the Leds and 1 for each of the buttons)
